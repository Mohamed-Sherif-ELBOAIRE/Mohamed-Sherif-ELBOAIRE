## Project Experience

- **Bike Rental Analysis: Predicting Demand and Factors Influencing Usage in the Capital Bikeshare System** | 2023
  - Analyzed bike rental patterns, Washington D.C., USA, utilizing two years of historical data from 2011 to 2012.
  - Applied KNN-regression, linear regression, and random forest algorithms to predict rental demand based on factors such as weather conditions, day of the week, and seasonal variations, achieving high R-squared scores of 0.97 for KNN, 0.99 for linear regression, and 0.997 for random forest.
  - Conducted thorough data preprocessing, including visualization, handling outliers and null values, and implementing feature scaling for KNN and linear regression models, while employing grid search with cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning in the random forest model.
  - Demonstrated the practical application of bike sharing data in understanding travel behavior, environmental impacts, and urban mobility, contributing to the field of transportation research and its implications for traffic, environmental sustainability, and public health.

- **Text Classification using Naive Bayes Algorithm** | 2023
  - Applied Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification on a dataset to categorize posts as positive or negative.
  - Extracted relevant columns and performed data preprocessing, including dropping unnecessary columns.
  - Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
  - Utilized CountVectorizer() to transform the text data into numerical features.
  - Created and trained a Naive Bayes model (Multinomial/ComplementNB) for classification.
  - Evaluated the model's performance on the test set, achieving accuracy scores of 95% for Multinomial and 93% for ComplementNB.
  - Presented visual metrics, including a confusion matrix and classification report, to assess the model's performance.

- **SIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR (Graduation Project)** | FCAI – Helwan University | 2022
  - Developed an AI-based mobile application for deaf individuals to improve their communication with the world by detecting sign language from mobile camera images and converting them into readable phrases, using a convolutional neural network trained on a preprocessed dataset of hand signs.
  - Minimized the translation error rate by 20% and increased the speed of English to Sign Language translation by 25% using existing AI models in the testing stage.
  - The application achieved an average precision score of 90% in recognizing hand signs from images.
